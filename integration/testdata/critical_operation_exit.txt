# Test critical operation exit behavior
# This test verifies that INIQ exits immediately when critical operations (like user creation) fail

# Test 1: User creation failure should cause immediate exit
# We'll test this by trying to create a user with conflicting password options
! exec iniq -u testuser --password --no-pass -y --dry-run -S
stdout 'cannot specify both --password and --no-pass options'
stdout 'Critical operation.*failed. Exiting...'

# Test 2: User creation failure in non-interactive mode should cause immediate exit
! exec iniq -u testuser -y --dry-run -S
stdout 'creating user.*requires password input'
stdout 'Critical operation.*failed. Exiting...'

# Test 3: Version command should still work (basic functionality test)
exec iniq version
stdout 'INIQ Version Information'

# Test 4: Help should work
exec iniq --help
stdout 'Usage:'
