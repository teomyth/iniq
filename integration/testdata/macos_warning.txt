# Test macOS warning functionality
# Note: These tests will behave differently on macOS vs Linux

# Test 1: Status command should show warning on macOS, but work on Linux
exec iniq --status -y
# On macOS: should show warning
# On Linux: should work normally
stdout 'INIQ SYSTEM STATUS'

# Test 2: Quiet mode should suppress warnings
exec iniq --status -q
stdout 'INIQ SYSTEM STATUS'
# Should not show macOS warning even on macOS

# Test 3: Help command should work without warnings (doesn't trigger main logic)
exec iniq --help
stdout 'INIQ'
stdout 'Usage:'

# Test 4: Version command should work without warnings
exec iniq version
stdout 'INIQ Version Information'

# Test 5: Dry run with user creation should show warning on macOS
exec iniq -u testuser --no-pass --dry-run -y -S
stdout 'Would create user testuser'
# On macOS: should also show warning
# On Linux: should work normally
